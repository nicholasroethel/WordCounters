# WordCounters
This repository contains multiple different word count programs written in both C and Python.

The programs read words and stores their frequencies. Each program then has the ability to print them in ascending word length, or descending frequencies. It is possible to print just the frequencies or the frequencies and the words that contributed. Repetitions and special characters are deleted. 

The differences with the C files are that dynamic program uses dynamic memory allocation and linked lists, whereas the other program uses arrays and does not use dynamic memory allocation.
